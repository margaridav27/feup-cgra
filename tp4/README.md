## TP 4 Notes

(add your main observations/remarks about your experiments here, in a bulleted list, and remove this line. Some examples below)

- In the 1st part, exs 1 to 3, of this week's exercises, the solution we found to differentiate the traingles was by adding an identifier parameter to the contructor of this object, approch we are still not sure to be the most efficient and, therefore, we look forward to discuss this detail with the teacher in the next pratical class.

- In the 2nd part, exs 4 to 7, of this week's exercises, we haven't had any difficulties.
