## TP 4 Notes

- In the 1st part of this practical class, we found a little hard to understand what we were supposed to do, since the concepts were significantly more complicated and complex. 
However, after analising the provided examples, we manage to complete all the taks without further difficulties.

- In the 2nd part of this practical class, we were not understanding, at first, how to manipulate the two images, the waterMap and the waterText, in order to create the bump texture desired. 
As what concerns the creation of the moving effect, the concepts were similiar to those of last week, reason why we didn't encounter any more difficulties.
