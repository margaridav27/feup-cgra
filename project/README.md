## Description

Subaquatic WebGL scene built using WebCGF that contains:

- surrounding environment (cubemap)
- sand terrain with elevations and a shell, created using a shader
- water surface with movement, created using a shader
- main fish, animated and controlable by the user using the following commands:
    - ``W`` - to move fish forward and to progressively increase fish's speed
    - ``S`` - to progressively decrease fish's speed
    - ``D`` - to turn fish in a counterclockwise direction
    - ``A`` - to turn fish in a clockwise direction
    - ``L`` - to move fish upwards
    - ``P`` - to move fish downwards
    - ``C`` - to pick a rock, if sufficiently closer, and drop it later on the shell
    - ``R`` - to reset fish to its initial position
- set of animated fishes, non-controlable by the user
- set of animated seaweed
- set of rocks, pickable by the controlable fish
- set of wood pillars, that contribute to the subaquatic ambience

In the next section, we present some representative screenshots of the elements mentioned above.
