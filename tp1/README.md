## TP 1 Notes


- In exercise 1 we observed X 
We wanted to change the colors to look like in the exercises but considering what we have learn so far, we were not able to figure out how to do so.
In general the exercises where easy to implement. Thanks to the "lesson" where the code was really good explained..



- In exercise 2 we had difficulties in Y
No dificulties.
