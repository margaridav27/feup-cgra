## TP 2 Notes

(add your main observations/remarks about your experiments here, in a bulleted list, and remove this line. Some examples below)

- Exercise 2 was really useful since it has provided us with a better understanding of how transformations really work.

- In exercise 2 we had difficulties essentially in the translations, because we were not sure about how much we were supposed to translate each object, since no dimensions were provided in the image of the tangram.


- In exercise 3 we had difficulties on the definition of the vertices to form the triangles. Also, we were not understanding, at first, the purpose of the cube behind the tangram, however we didn't find it difficult to achieve the purposes of the exercise once we understood what we were supposed to do.


- In exercise 4, we didn't found any difficulties. However, one thing we noticed was that with the cube formed with triangles, the edges weren't so visible when compared with the cube formed with translations of the quad.
